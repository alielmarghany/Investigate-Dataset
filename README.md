# Investigate-Dataset
The project involves the investigation of a movie dataset, encompassing data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and conclusions. The analysis addresses issues such as missing data, duplicates, and data cleaning, including changing inappropriate column names and correcting data types. The dataset is explored to identify trends in movie releases, such as the average runtime, the average number of movies released per year, the least popular movies, the movie with the highest budget, the movie with the highest average rating, the most popular genre, and the production company that has produced the most movies. The findings suggest a general upward trend in the number of movie releases over the years, with occasional fluctuations observed. However, the analysis acknowledges the need for further research to understand the underlying factors driving these trends and emphasizes the importance of interpreting the findings with caution, considering limitations and external factors. Additionally, the project highlights the absence of consideration for seasonal variations in movie releases and the necessity for further investigation to establish causal relationships between variables. The project also provides insights into the most popular genre and the production company that has produced the most movies. Overall, the project offers valuable insights into movie release trends while recognizing the need for further research and careful interpretation of the findings.
